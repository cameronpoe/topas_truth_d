Dear Henry,

I will come to your office an hour later at 10:30am, if it works with you?

Briefly:
 *  I have seen Luigi and have started the machine shop training making a
    cuvette holder for João this Tuesday.
 *  Still have no contact from Jin, I guess we just need to move on starting
    anew on anode.
 *  Kind of figured out what I want to do for the future, it would still be
    electrical engineering, but for physics experiments. And I shall apply for
    that. I am definitely still going for grad.
 *  Got my bachelor’s thesis project with Jon Simon on building FPGA.
 *  Scheduled my time for anode in two chunk of 5, on Tuesday and Thursday
    afternoon 2-7p, and weekends.
There are still much details, we should discuss those in person.

Thanks!

Best Wishes,
Jacky

主题: talking  
Dear Jacky,
         Did you make contact with Luigi in the machine shop?
Also, more importantly, did you come to some conclusions about work?
Should we talk again?
